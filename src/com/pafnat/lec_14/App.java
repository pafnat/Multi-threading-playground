/**
 * how to interrupt running threads in Java using the built-in thread
 * interruption mechanism.
 *
 * Source:http://www.javamex.com/tutorials/threads/thread_interruption.shtml
 * Incidentally, it is important not to confuse thread interruption with either
 * software interrupts (where the CPU automatically interrupts the current
 * instruction flow in order to call a registered piece of code periodicallyâ€” as
 * in fact happens to drive the thread scheduler) and hardware interrupts (where
 * the CPU automatically performs a similar task in response to some hardware
 * signal).
